// Conversions for IDBKey.
//
// Per http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#key-construct
//
// "A value is said to be a valid key if it is one of the following types: Array
// JavaScript objects [ECMA-262], DOMString [WEBIDL], Date [ECMA-262] or float
// [WEBIDL]. However Arrays are only valid keys if every item in the array is
// defined and is a valid key (i.e. sparse arrays can not be valid keys) and if
// the Array doesn't directly or indirectly contain itself. Any non-numeric
// properties are ignored, and thus does not affect whether the Array is a valid
// key. Additionally, if the value is of type float, it is only a valid key if
// it is not NaN, and if the value is of type Date it is only a valid key if its
// [[PrimitiveValue]] internal property, as defined by [ECMA-262], is not NaN."

// What is required is to ensure that an Lists in the key are actually
// JavaScript arrays, and any Dates are JavaScript Dates.

// Conversions for Window.  These check if the window is the local
// window, and if it's not, wraps or unwraps it with a secure wrapper.
// We need to test for EventTarget here as well as it's a base type.
// We omit an unwrapper for Window as no methods take a non-local
// window as a parameter.
